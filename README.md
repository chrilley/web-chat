Experimenting with SignalR by making a simple chat client with a backend & frontend. 


## Instructions: Repo
> **1) Clone this repo to your local workstation**
>
## Instructions: Frontend
>
> **1) Install Node.js and Node Package Manager https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm**
>
> **2) Navigate to the downloaded repo "web-chat/.web-chat-frontend" using your favorite terminal.**
>
> **3) Once within the previously mentioned folder, type "npm ci" to download all the neccessary dependencies**
>
> **4) Build App & Run Server by typing 'npm start' within the "web-chat/.web-chat-frontend" folder**
>
> **5) You can now run the app by visiting it at http://localhost:1234 (or whichever port Parcel reports back to you. 1234 is default)**

>
> **3) Navigate to the downloaded repo "web-chat/ChatClient/" using your favorite terminal.**

>
> **5) Build App & Run Server by typing 'dotnet run' within the "web-chat/ChatClient/" folder**
